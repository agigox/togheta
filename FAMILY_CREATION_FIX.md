# Family Creation Bug Fix

## Issue Identified
When trying to create a family after signing in, the system was failing with an error:
```
ERROR  Error updating user familyId: [FirebaseError: No document to update: projects/togheta-fec6a/databases/(default)/documents/users/a's Family]
```

## Root Cause
The bug was in the Zustand family store (`src/stores/familyStore.ts`) where the parameters were being passed in the wrong order to the Firebase functions:

### Wrong (Before Fix):
```typescript
// In createNewFamily method
const newFamilyId = await createFamily(familyName, userId);

// In joinFamily method  
const joinedFamilyId = await joinFamilyWithCode(inviteCode, userId);
```

### Correct (After Fix):
```typescript
// In createNewFamily method
const newFamilyId = await createFamily(userId, familyName);

// In joinFamily method
const joinedFamilyId = await joinFamilyWithCode(userId, inviteCode);
```

## Expected Function Signatures
- `createFamily(creatorUid: string, familyName?: string): Promise<string>`
- `joinFamilyWithCode(uid: string, inviteCode: string): Promise<string>`

## What Was Happening
1. User signs up with email "a@a.com" (uid: "kdDjS2PJqydTmWBQoIFn2KEWbod2")
2. System tries to create family named "a's Family"
3. **BUG**: Called `createFamily("a's Family", "kdDjS2PJqydTmWBQoIFn2KEWbod2")`
4. Firebase function interpreted "a's Family" as the user ID
5. Tried to update user document with ID "a's Family" (which doesn't exist)
6. Firebase error: "No document to update"

## Fix Applied ✅
- ✅ Fixed parameter order in `createNewFamily` method
- ✅ Fixed parameter order in `joinFamily` method
- ✅ Verified TypeScript compilation passes for main code
- ✅ Tests still pass

## Next Steps
1. **Test the fix**: Try creating a family again - it should now work correctly
2. **Test joining**: Try joining a family with an invite code
3. **Verify both flows**: Both family creation and joining should work without Firebase errors

The family creation and joining functionality should now work correctly!
