# Togheta – Family Task Management App

## 🎉 **ONBOARDING SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!**

A complete family task management application with Firebase authentication, family creation/joining, and real-time task synchronization.

### **✅ Core Features Implemented:**

#### **🔐 Firebase Authentication**
- Email/password signup and login
- Persistent authentication with secure storage
- Auto-redirect based on authentication status

#### **🏠 Family Management System**
- **Smart Onboarding Flow**: After login, users are guided to create or join a family
- **Family Creation**: Generate invite codes, create family documents, assign admin roles
- **Family Joining**: Join families using 6-digit invite codes with validation
- **Member Management**: Subcollections for family members with roles (admin/member)
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic sync across all family members

#### **📋 Task Management**
- **Family-scoped Tasks**: All tasks are shared within the family
- **Real-time Sync**: Tasks update instantly across all devices
- **Add/Complete Tasks**: Simple interface for task management
- **User Assignment**: Tasks can be assigned to family members

#### **🚀 Routing & Navigation**
- **Smart Navigation**: Automatic routing based on user state
  - Unauthenticated → `/auth`
  - Authenticated + No familyId → `/onboarding`  
  - Authenticated + Has familyId → `/tasks`
- **Real-time State Detection**: Instant navigation updates when family status changes

## 🏗️ **Implementation Details**

### **Onboarding Flow** (`/app/onboarding.tsx`)
Beautiful welcome screen with two main options:

**🏠 Start New Family:**
- Generates random 6-character `inviteCode`
- Creates family document in Firestore
- Adds user as admin member to family subcollection
- Updates user document with `familyId` and `role = admin`
- Shows success toast and redirects to tasks

**🔗 Join with Invite Code:**
- Input form for 6-digit code validation
- Finds family by `inviteCode` in families collection
- Adds user as member to family subcollection  
- Updates user document with `familyId` and `role = member`
- Error handling for invalid codes and duplicate joins

### **Database Structure**
```
/families/{familyId}
├── name: string
├── createdBy: string (uid)
├── createdAt: Timestamp
└── inviteCode: string

/families/{familyId}/members/{uid}
├── uid: string
├── role: 'admin' | 'member'
├── joinedAt: Timestamp
├── displayName?: string
└── email?: string

/users/{uid}
├── uid: string
├── displayName: string
├── email: string
├── familyId: string | null
├── role: 'admin' | 'member'
└── joinedAt: Timestamp

/tasks/{taskId}
├── title: string
├── completed: boolean
├── familyId: string
├── createdAt: Timestamp
└── assignedTo?: string
```

### **Key Services & Hooks**

#### **Firebase Services** (`src/firebase/families.ts`)
- `createFamily(creatorUid, familyName?)` - Creates new family with admin
- `joinFamilyWithCode(uid, inviteCode)` - Joins family using invite code
- `syncUserToFirestore(user, familyId?)` - Syncs user data to Firestore
- `addMemberToFamily(familyId, uid, role)` - Adds member to family
- `updateUserFamilyId(uid, familyId)` - Updates user's family association

#### **Custom Hooks**
- `useAuth()` - Authentication state management
- `useUserFamily()` - Real-time family status detection
- `useFamily()` - Family data and member management
- `useTasks(familyId)` - Real-time task management

### **Fixed Issues**
- ✅ **Duplicate Family Creation**: Completely resolved by separating auth and family logic
- ✅ **Race Conditions**: Proper loading states and error handling
- ✅ **Permission Errors**: Correct Firestore security implementation
- ✅ **Navigation Issues**: Smart routing based on user state
