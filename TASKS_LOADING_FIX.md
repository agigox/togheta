# Tasks Loading Issue Fix

## Issue Identified
After family creation was successful, the tasks page was still showing a loading state because it was waiting for `familyLoading` to be `false`. However, the tasks page doesn't actually need the full family data to be loaded - it only needs the `familyId` to function.

## Root Cause
The tasks route protection logic was checking both `authLoading` and `familyLoading`:
```typescript
if (!authLoading && !familyLoading) {
  // Route logic
}
```

But the family data loading is not essential for the tasks page to function. The tasks page only needs:
1. User to be authenticated
2. User to have a family ID

## Fix Applied ✅

### Updated Tasks Route (`app/tasks.tsx`)
- ✅ Removed dependency on `familyLoading` state
- ✅ Only check `authLoading` for route protection
- ✅ Allow tasks page to render as soon as user has `familyId`
- ✅ Family data can load in the background

### Before:
```typescript
if (!authLoading && !familyLoading) {
  // Route logic
}
```

### After:
```typescript
if (!authLoading) {
  // Route logic
}
```

## How TaskScreen Works
The `TaskScreen` component only needs `familyId` to:
1. Subscribe to tasks for that family
2. Display and manage tasks

The full family data (name, members, etc.) is not required for basic task functionality.

## Result ✅
- ✅ Family creation works correctly
- ✅ Tasks page loads immediately after family creation
- ✅ Family data can load in the background without blocking UI
- ✅ User experience is much smoother

The tasks page should now be accessible immediately after family creation!
